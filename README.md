## Iciar Novo Fernández

After 10 years in video editing I wanted a new challenge. Attracted by different technology and a fresh new encounter I began my journey into web design, stimulated from learning new skills and implementing these in new assignments. I find my motivation in creating and developing new projects to a client’s specifications. While entering into any task my approach is friendly and professional displaying excellent standards in communication that will always strive to meet any fixed deadlines.

## Skills

#### HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Jquery

I’ve worked in some projects as front-end developer what allowed me to improve my skills and have experience on:
  - Interpreting graphic visuals
  - Interaction designs in HMTL, CSS and Javascript
  -	Employ the jQuery library for visual effects
  -	Event Handling
  -	Document Manipulation 
  -	Testing cross-browser, cross platform, and/or cross-device compatibility for inconsistencies
  -	Best practice in CSS file organization and structure

#### Agile

While in attendance at Makers Academy I was introduced to an Agile Environment. I would work along side appointed fellow students throughout the course to gain new skills with problem solving, this enabled me to improve with my confidence abilities while working as part of a team. The sessions were twice daily using the processes of Scrum and Kanban, we would communicate with each other, co-ordinate our tasks, talk about obstacles that would stop us in the process.

#### BDD

After working on projects in TDD I began to understand how important it is to work through the testing process, making sure the assignment succeeds and debugging to help with the next step in the creation of a web application. I found it a useful practice to look at the whole project through the creation of User Stories; this is how I would determine my MVp’s.

I have used Cucumber, Rspec and Capybara for Ruby based projects and Protractor and Jasmine for Angular and Javascript products.

#### Git

After learning about GIT I began to use it on every single project, quickly becoming familiar with all the commands. On the last project I followed the GIT branching model with my co-workers, creating branch for feature, merging with develop and finally master and solving problems given to some error committed
